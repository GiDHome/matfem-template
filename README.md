### MatFem project (used as template)
Mat-fem is a computer program designed for introducing users to the practical use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for analysis of structures and field problems governed by the Poisson and Laplace equations (heat transfer, acoustics, seepage, electromagnetics, etc.).

Mat-fem is written in Matlab and has a user-friendly graphical user interface with the GiD pre-postprocessor (www.gidhome.com)
